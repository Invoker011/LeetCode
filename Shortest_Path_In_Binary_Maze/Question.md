Given an n x m matrix grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1, determine the shortest distance between a source cell and a destination cell. You can move to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) if that adjacent cell has a value of 1. The path can only be created out of cells containing 1. If the destination cell is not reachable from the source cell, return -1.


Example 1

Input: grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 0, 1],[1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 0, 0],[1, 0, 0, 1]], source = [0, 1], destination = [2, 2]

Output: 3

Explanation: The shortest path from (0, 1) to (2, 2) is:

Move down to (1, 1)

Move down to (2, 1)

Move right to (2, 2)

Thus, the shortest distance is 3
